## microSD card
In my opinion capacity of the card should be 16GB. I prefere `sanDisk`.

## Flash Raspberrian into microSD
Install downloaded image on microSD. I use [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to do it. It's easy to use. It has one feature - mount `.img` files into microDS card and nothin else!
