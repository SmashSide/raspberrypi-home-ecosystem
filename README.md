# Smart home based on Raspberry Pi
Guidelines of how to build smart home ecosystem based on Raspberry Pi. Why *Raspberry*? Because it's not so expensive as the solutions "out of the box".
This is first step to create smart home.

## Base congifuration for the single-board computers
[Full description](BASE_CONFIGURATION.md) [:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi) Go Top.
  1. Download [Raspberrian OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). All the guidelines describe the case with *Raspbian Stretch Lite*, image with only commandline.
  2. Get microSD card on 16GB+. I prefere sanDisk 16GB.
  3. Format microSD cart to FAT32 format. I use *CD Card Formatter* on MacOS.
  4. Install downloaded image on microSD. I use *balenaEtcher* to do it.

## Main server based on Raspberry Pi Modeb 3b+
[:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi) To be added 

## Camera monitoring based on Raspberry Pi Zero W
[:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi) To be added

## Monitoring home state with different sensors
[:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi)
In a nutshell:
* CO2 Sensor
* Humidity sensor
* air temperature sensor
* etc

## Local internet customising based on Orange Pi R1

# Usage
[:arrow_up:](#smart-home-based-on-raspberry-pi)
Step by step these guidelines can be used for creating own smart home ecosystem.

You can use two ways to do it. 
* First is to go step by step throw the description.
* Second is to run bash scripts, which are based on the guidelines.

If you have any ideas of how to improve these apporoach or you have ideas about new features - welcome!
The main idea is to provide the solution which won't really expensive. So think in this way ;)
